A simple program that launches before your minecraft launcher, used to configure forge mod folders.

Installation instructions:
- Put the .exe in the same directory as your minecraft launcher exe
- Replace all Minecraft Launcher shortcuts with shortcuts to the Prelauncher
- All folders are automatically created when you first launch the program

use the "launch" command in the prelauncher to start the normal launcher!


Commands List: (accessible through the help command in the program)

editmode commands list:

    add [filename] : adds a file to the selected modfolder (NOTE: mod must be in your minecraft or prelauncher mods folder!)
    
    remove [filename] : removes a file from the selected modfolder
    
    exit : exits editmode (does not exit the program)
    
    list : lists the mods in the selected modfolder
